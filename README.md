# OpenHoerLevin
OpenHoerLevin is a open and free mp3 player for kids. Follow the idea of Hoerbert (https://de-de.hoerbert.com/) build with wood and some electronic scrap.

Some cheap hardware from china:
* Evaluationsboard C-Control Open IoT WIFI Board Arduinoâ„¢ Nano compatible (http://www.conrad.ch/ce/de/product/1387029/Evaluationsboard-C-Control-Open-IoT-WIFI-Board-Arduino-Nano-compatible?queryFromSuggest=true)
* UART Serial MP3 Music Player Module w/ 1W Speaker for Arduino (http://www.dx.com/p/uart-serial-mp3-music-player-module-w-1w-speaker-for-arduino-440175#.WEGoAGdJn6I)
* DIY 4 x 4 Matrix Keypad - Blue + Red (http://www.dx.com/p/diy-4-x-4-matrix-keypad-blue-red-257119#.WEGqAGdJn6I)
* Wire, switches, ..
* Wood

Attention: Most hardware came without any documentation, spec can be found in the internet but similar products arn't compatible. Of corse the project is also possible with other Arduino boards and moduls but some specs could be different. The IoT WIFI Nano Board came from another project and isn't the cheepest board, but with the Wifi it is open for next freeking feature - we will see.
